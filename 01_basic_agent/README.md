# Example 1: Basic Agent with Tools

This is the first example in the Agno learning series. We'll build a **Level 1** agent that has tools and instructions.

## What You'll Learn
- How to create a basic Agno agent
- How to use built-in tools
- How to give instructions to your agent
- Basic agent interaction

## What We're Building
A simple agent that can:
- Answer questions using reasoning tools
- Get current time and date
- Perform basic calculations
- Follow specific instructions

## Files
- `basic_agent.py` - The main agent code
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `run_example.py` - Script to test the agent

## Next Steps
After this example, you'll learn about:
- Agents with knowledge and storage (Level 2)
- Agents with memory and reasoning (Level 3)
- Multi-agent teams (Level 4)
- Complex workflows (Level 5)
