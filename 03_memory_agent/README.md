# Example 3: Memory Agent with Reasoning

This is the third example in the Agno learning series. We'll build a **Level 3** agent that has memory and reasoning capabilities across sessions.

## What You'll Learn
- How to create agents with persistent memory
- How to enable reasoning across multiple conversations
- How to use session management and memory storage
- How to build agents that learn and improve over time

## What We're Building
A memory-enabled agent that can:
- Remember conversations and context across sessions
- Use reasoning tools to work through complex problems
- Maintain conversation history and learn from interactions
- Provide consistent responses based on previous knowledge

## Key Differences from Previous Examples
- **Level 1**: Basic tools and instructions
- **Level 2**: Knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Level 3**: Memory, reasoning, and session persistence
- **New Features**: Memory storage, session management, reasoning workflows

## Files
- `memory_agent.py` - The main agent code with memory capabilities
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `run_example.py` - Interactive script to test memory persistence
- `setup.md` - Setup and usage guide
- `memory_test.py` - Script to demonstrate memory across sessions

## Next Steps
After this example, you'll learn about:
- Multi-agent teams (Level 4)
- Complex workflows (Level 5)
