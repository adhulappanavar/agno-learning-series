Example 4: Team Agents (Level 4)
================================

This example demonstrates a Level 4 Agno system with multiple agents working together:
- A Project Manager agent that coordinates the team
- A Developer agent that handles technical implementation
- A Designer agent that focuses on user experience
- A QA Tester agent that ensures quality
- Team collaboration and communication protocols
