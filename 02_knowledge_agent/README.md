# Example 2: Knowledge Agent with Storage

This is the second example in the Agno learning series. We'll build a **Level 2** agent that has knowledge and storage capabilities.

## What You'll Learn
- How to create agents with knowledge bases
- How to use vector storage for information retrieval
- How to enable agents to learn and remember information
- How to build agents that can answer questions about specific domains

## What We're Building
A knowledge agent that can:
- Load documents into a knowledge base using Agno's built-in system
- Demonstrate knowledge storage capabilities
- Show how to structure documents for the knowledge system
- Provide a foundation for more advanced knowledge retrieval

**Note**: This example focuses on knowledge loading and basic retrieval. For production use with large document collections, you may want to configure a vector database like ChromaDB for optimal performance.

## Key Differences from Example 1
- **Level 1**: Basic tools and instructions
- **Level 2**: Knowledge storage and retrieval capabilities
- **New Features**: Vector database integration, document storage, semantic search

## Files
- `knowledge_agent.py` - The main agent code with knowledge capabilities
- `sample_documents/` - Sample documents to populate the knowledge base
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies including vector database
- `run_example.py` - Script to test the knowledge agent
- `setup.md` - Setup and usage guide

## Next Steps
After this example, you'll learn about:
- Agents with memory and reasoning (Level 3)
- Multi-agent teams (Level 4)
- Complex workflows (Level 5)
